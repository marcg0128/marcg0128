# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcos 

## 🙇 About me 

I’m a 16-year-old developer from Spain, now living in Germany. I started coding in 2020 with Python and have since worked on web development projects, satisfying several clients. 


## 🛠️ Skills

My skills include Python, HTML, and CSS, and I’m currently learning LUA, JavaScript, and C#. I’m always open to collaborations and seeking guidance in C# for game development. Fun fact: my first project was a Discord bot!
